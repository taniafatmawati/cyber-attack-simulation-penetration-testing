# Cyber Attack Simulation for Penetration Testing on Kali Linux üöÄ

Welcome to my Cyber Attack Simulation documentation! This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to simulating various cyberattacks using Kali Linux tools to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures on a target server.

## üåü Introduction 

This documentation focuses on simulating specific cyberattacks to assess the effectiveness of security hardening measures. Each simulation tests different aspects of a server‚Äôs defense mechanisms, providing valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of security controls.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Implement

### Environment Setup

Install Kali Linux:
1. Download from the official website.
2. Follow the installation instructions.

Update System:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install Penetration Testing Tools:
```bash
sudo apt install nmap ncat hping3 ettercap-common ettercap-graphical bettercap wireshark
sudo apt install hydra
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install sqlmap
sudo apt install gobuster
```

### Execute Attack Simulations

1. **Brute-Force Attack:**
   - Description: Attempts to gain unauthorized access by trying numerous password combinations.
   - Impact: Can compromise user accounts if weak passwords are used.
   - Target: SSH service.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     hydra -l <username> -P <password_list> ssh://<TARGET_IP>
     ```
     
2. **Firewall Bypass Attempt:**
   - Description: Tests if firewall rules can be evaded.
   - Impact: Potentially exposes services that should be protected by the firewall.
   - Target: Open ports through firewall.
   - Commands:

     Identify firewall rules:
     ```bash
     nmap -p- <TARGET_IP>
     ```

     Attempt bypass:
     ```bash
     nmap -f -p <TARGET_PORT> <TARGET_IP>
     ```
     
3. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:**
   - Description: Overwhelms a service to make it unavailable.
   - Impact: Service disruption or downtime.
   - Target: Web server or application.
   - Commands:

     Using hping3:
     ```bash
     sudo hping3 --flood -p 80 <TARGET_IP>
     ```
   
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**
   - Description: Intercepts and manipulates communication between two parties.
   - Impact: Data leakage or alteration.
   - Target: Network traffic between clients and servers.
   - Commands:

     Use Ettercap:
     ```bash
     sudo ettercap -T -M arp:remote /<TARGET_IP>/ /<GATEWAY_IP>/
     ```

     Capture traffic:
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w /root/mitm_data.pcap
     ```

     Analyze with Wireshark:
     ```bash
     sudo wireshark /root/mitm_data.pcap
     ```
     
5. **SQL Injection:**
   - Description: Injects malicious SQL queries to manipulate a database.
   - Impact: Unauthorized access to database or data corruption.
   - Target: Web applications with SQL databases.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     sqlmap -u "<TARGET_URL>" --dbs
     ```

6. **Network Sniffing:**
   - Description: Captures and analyzes network traffic to extract sensitive information.
   - Impact: Exposure of unencrypted data.
   - Target: Network traffic.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w /root/network_traffic.pcap
     ```

7. **Session Hijacking:**
    - Description: Takes over an active user session.
    - Impact: Unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
    - Target: Web sessions.
    - Command:
      ```bash
      sudo ettercap -T -M arp:remote /<TARGET_IP>/ /<GATEWAY_IP>/
      ```

8. **Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    - Description: Exploits a vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on a remote system.
    - Impact: Full control over the remote system.
    - Target: Remote servers with RCE vulnerabilities.
    - Command:
      ```bash
      msfconsole
      use exploit/linux/http/<exploit_module>
      set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>
      exploit
      ```
      
9. **Password Cracking:**
    - Description: Uses various techniques to recover passwords from hashes.
    - Impact: Compromise of user accounts.
    - Target: Password hashes.
    - Command:
      ```bash
      john --wordlist=<wordlist> <hash_file>
      ```

10. **Wi-Fi Network Attack:**
    - Description: Attacks Wi-Fi networks to crack passwords or intercept traffic.
    - Impact: Unauthorized access to network and data.
    - Target: Wi-Fi networks.
    - Command:
      ```bash
      aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -b <BSSID> <capture_file>
      ```

11. **DNS Spoofing:**
    - Description: Redirects DNS requests to malicious servers.
    - Impact: Phishing or data interception.
    - Target: DNS traffic.
    - Command:
      ```bash
      sudo ettercap -T -M arp:remote /<TARGET_IP>/ /<DNS_SERVER_IP>/
      ```

12. **Web Application Scanning:**
    - Description: Scans web applications for vulnerabilities.
    - Impact: Identifies weaknesses for further exploitation.
    - Target: Web applications.
    - Command:
      ```bash
      nikto -h <TARGET_URL>
      ```
